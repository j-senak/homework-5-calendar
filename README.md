# homework-5-calendar
For this project, I am making a work day calendar that keeps track of time and stores to-do's. When the user types into the text area and hits the lock icon, the text is then stored in local storage.

# Why?
With the work place enviornment pace getting faster and faster, employees need a way to keep up. With an interactive and dynamic calendar, employees will be able to keep track of appointments and tasks to maintain high productiveness.

# The Process
I started with a basic html and CSS, importing files from Bootstrap, jQuery, and moment.js. From there, I was able to use JavaScript to make a more dynamic page to keep track of time and generate the rows. Then, I set the time on the page from moment.js so that CSS applies to lines based on time of day. With that applied, I worked on ctreating the interactive lock button to save your text boxes to local storage, but I had trouble getting that to function properly as of now.
